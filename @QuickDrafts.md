Hello, everyone! Today I would like to introduce a book named Pride and Prejudice to you.

You may not be able to guess that the author of this book is a female. Her name is Jane Austen. At that time, it was very difficult for female writers to create and publish literary works, and so was Jane. Jane began to write when she was just 11 years old, and by the age of 23 she had already drafted early versions of some of her most famous novels, including Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. All of Jane’s work was published anonymously. Despite the fact that her work was generally well received and even became fashionable in some circles, she achieved little recognition until after her death. However, Comments on her work are polarized. On the one hand, Austin's works are relaxed and humorous, full of comic conflict. Because Austin lived in the countryside with strong feudal power all his life, and her family was rich, her life circle was very small. This makes her works often limited to the love and marriage stories of the daughters of ordinary squires, and her works also reflect the views of feudal forces to some extent. The work mainly reflects the moral standards of family and society through the social communication and daily dialogue of ladies and gentlemen. This makes Austin's works regarded as popular books for a long time. On the other hand, her works reflects the social situation at that time through the daily dialogue and communication of gentlemen and wives, satirizes the phenomenon of mercenary and vanity with humorous language, and ridicules people's despicable and ridiculous weaknesses such as stupidity, selfishness, snobbery and blind self-confidence through comic scenes.

Pride and Prejudice shows different marriages and love in the 18th century in England and also portrays lots of characters such as Elizabeth, Darcy, Jane, Bingley and so on. Our heroine is Elizabeth Bennet, a smart country girl. She is the second of the five daughters in her family. Under their mother’s arrangement, the five girls attended a ball to get familiar with Mr.Bingley. During the ball, Elizabeth’s elder sister Jane fell in love with Mr.Bingley while Elizabeth heard Bingley’s friend Mr.Darcy’ s rude words towards her. However, as times going by, Mr.Darcy found he had fell in love with Elizabeth out of control. In the meantime, Elizabeth was attracted by a militia officer named Mr.Wickham, who was handsome and polite. Mr.Wickham told Elizabeth his miserable childhood and he said Mr.Darcy’s cold blood and dishonesty is the reason led to his terrible situation. His words deepen Elizabeth’s prejudice towards Mr.Darcy. As a result, when she heard that Mr.Darcy had persuaded Bingley not to get married with her sister Jane, she can’t control her boiling anger. So when Mr.Darcy confessed to her, she refused and scold him angrily. However, the second day she received a letter written by Darcy, which made her reflected on her prejudice and rude attitude towards him. She surprisingly found that Mr.Wickham was the one who cheated her.The truth made Elizabeth feel shamed and guilty.What’s more, it’s surprising for her to find Darcy begin to change his behavior from the haughty one to the modest one. His spirit of admitting and overcoming shortages touched her and she also found her admiration towards him gradually. At the end of the story, Jane and Bingley finally was together while Darcy also confessed again towards Elizabeth, who delightedly agreed. But on the contrary, their younger sister Lidia eloped with Mr.Wickham who just want to take advantage of her to obtain her properties.And their hasty marriage was not so happy.

In this novel, Austin reflects her own view of marriage: it is wrong to marry for property, money and status. However, it is also foolish to marry without considering the above factors. Therefore, she opposes both marriage for money and taking marriage as a child's play. She stressed the importance of an ideal marriage and took the feelings of men and women as the basics of an ideal marriage. This book conveys the author's understanding of marriage and reflects women's pursuit of personality independence and equal rights. Darcy and Elizabeth had a gap in family status and wealth. Darcy was full of arrogance at the beginning, and Elizabeth also had a lot of prejudice against him. After a series of things, Darcy is no longer arrogant and conceited, Elizabeth also eliminate prejudice, they get married. Through the figure of Elizabeth, it is conveyed that women should have self-esteem and pursue independence. Austin hopes to help people get rid of the shackles of traditional ideas, so as to find and realize themselves.
